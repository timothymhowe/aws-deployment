# Mini-project IV

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Hypothesis
Based on an initial look at the data as well as a modicum of domain knowledge, I hypothesize that the following factors will have a significant impact on the probability of a loan being granted:
 - Good Credit History
 - High Combined Household Income (both absolute and relative to size of Loan)
 - Few dependents
 - Urban > Suburban > Rural 
 - Marital Status (but the effect will be mostly accounted for by combined household income)
 - Level of Education (accounted for by income as well)
 - Applicant Gender (Not sure which way this will go, there could be institutionalized sexism making it harder for women to get loans, but there could also be some cultural norms that create self-selection bias for women.  Could also be similar to car insurance, where women in the aggregate are seen as less of a financial risk than men.)
 
 Effectively, I expect the most likely candidate for the loan to be urban, educated DINKs (Dual Income, No Kids) with good credit.
